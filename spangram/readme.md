# Spangram

Based on the NYT game [Strands](https://www.nytimes.com/games/strands)

Given a grid of letters, find words that can be formed by connecting adjacent letters. All letters must be used exactly once.

The program reads a grid of letters from standard input. A file name containing a word list, the expected word count, and a list of forbidden words can be passed as arguments.

## Word lists

Try the following word lists:
- Fewer words: [high-frequency-vocabulary/30k.txt](https://github.com/arstgit/high-frequency-vocabulary/blob/master/30k.txt)
- More words: [english-words/words.txt](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/blob/master/words.txt)

## Sample usage:

    ./spangram words.txt 8 nori born elelments < in

## Tips

- If the solution generated by the program is not the one you want, run it again by making some words in the solution forbidden
